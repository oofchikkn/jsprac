  <h1>Python Sucks!</h1>

  <h2>Reason 1: Python relies on variables.</h2>
  <p>Using random variables over and over doesn't teach you anything. You only learn one part of code. As you repeat
    this skill over and over, you fail to advance and learn other concepts. You fail to create anything meaningful, like
    Brian and his "Brady is kool" "Brady is ool" program. Meanwhile, Javascript, along with its visual components HTML
    and CSS, can not only generate websites but also create online tools for people to use.</p>

  <h2>Reason 2: Python is used for cryptocurrencies.</h2>
  <p>Python is used to power many leading cryptocurrencies. Cryptocurrency, or crypto as it is commonly known, produces
    a massive amount of emissions contributing to climate change. Crypto is unstable, causing many unlucky people to
    lose their entire fortunes. Finally, crypto has produced some of the most annoying people on the planet: NFT bros.</p>
