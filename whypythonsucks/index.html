  <title>Why Python Sucks</title>
</head>

<body>
  <h1>Python Sucks!</h1>

  <h2>Reason 1: Python relies on variables.</h2>
  <p class="first">Using random variables over and over doesn't teach you anything. You only learn one part of code. As
    you repeat
    this skill over and over, you fail to advance and learn other concepts. You fail to create anything meaningful, like
    Brian and his "Brady is kool" "Brady is ool" program. Meanwhile, Javascript, along with its visual components HTML
    and CSS, can not only generate websites but also create online tools for people to use.</p>

  <h2>Reason 2: Python is used for cryptocurrencies.</h2>
  <p class="second">Python is used to power many leading cryptocurrencies. Cryptocurrency, or crypto as it is commonly
    known, produces
    a massive amount of emissions contributing to climate change. Crypto is unstable, causing many unlucky people to
    lose their entire fortunes. Finally, crypto has produced some of the most annoying people on the planet: NFT bros.
  </p>

  <h2>Reason 3: The experts agree. Python sucks.</h2>
  <p class="third">Not convinced by what I have to say? I wouldn't be either. There's just not enough here to make it
    work. But other
    informed voices agree: Python sucks! Why not listen to what this <a
      href="https://medium.com/nerd-for-tech/python-is-a-bad-programming-language-2ab73b0bda5">programmer</a> has to say
    about it.

  <h2>What can I use instead?</h2>
  <p>If you're interested in websites, why not try JavaScript, HTML, and CSS? These three languages are a full suite of
    web tools that work together. Javascript forms the backend, HTML forms the visuals, and CSS styles the visuals. </p>
